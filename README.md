# SnapIT HacktoberFest
This is an open source project created to allow our apprentice developers, and others to learn and practice. It is an informational website that directs users to our in-person and virtual hackathons.

We hope you will participate in making this project great, and we look forward to seeing you at the next hackathon!

### Switch to the project version of Node.js

## Development

### Commits

#### Pre-Commit Hook

This repository has a pre-commit hook that will attempt to correct any linting and formatting
issues. If there are any files that still contain lint after running the pre-commit hook, the commit
will fail, and you will have to manually correct the issues.
